    bio: "Foley likes to play with viewers’ experiences of reality by playing around with the traditional styles of landscape and still life, in textured pieces that make you question their two dimensions. “This trompe l’oeil that I work with is not to deceive but to confuse the haptic expectations and bodily position of the audience,” explains Foley, whose work is collected both in Australia and overseas, including Tasmania’s cultural cathedral Mona.",

      "It has given me an opportunity to explore the subject of AI more thoroughly. I enjoy the conceptual implications. I’m not concerned about this phenomena, as our own intelligence is also partially coded, algorithmic, artificial. We can understand ourselves further by observing this manufactured reflection of us, and how that manipulates and interacts with our digital universe.",

There’s something inherently joyful in his creations. “Young is a fearless colourist… more is never enough,” enthuses arts writer Dr Jane Deeth. “The sense of delight and fun that rolls across the panoply of vibrant canvases is infectious.”",

      "In Tassie, you really don’t have to rush. You can take your time. When I come back from the mainland, I have to remind myself to slow down.\n\n I think that the slower pace helps creativity because we have time to think. Just the view of kunanyi when I look out of my studio makes me feel relaxed and ready to draw or paint.\n\n Because this is a small place, we are a close community.  It is much easier to be creative when you have a supportive artist’s community around you.",

It also allowed me to look in on my own practice and reminded me of the depth and substance of my work which will never be achieved by AI.",
    unique:
      "I often think about our isolation and the wildness of our island that allows for such unique creativity. We are worlds away from the hustle and bustle of big cities and that freedom allows us the privilege of a slowed and meaningful view of the world around us. This is what usually feeds into my world view and the inspirations I take to form creative expressions through art.",

His works consist of quite a layered process across various media that brings them all to fruition. “I almost always start out in pencil, primarily mechanical pencils so I can get as much detail as possible into my drawings,” he says. From there he may add watercolours to punctuate some elements, before then transferring to computer “for additional digital colouring and painting”.",

      "This project is such an excellent idea to show off what amazing talent we have here in Tasmania, and an even better way to show that AI “art” is a poor imitation of what we’re able to create. It’s truly an honour to be creating artworks alongside all involved.",

The constraints of the project were inspiring and conducive to my creative practice. It’s such a unique project that builds on community, which is a big part of being Tasmanian.",
    unique:
      "I think there is something about our secluded and wild island that breeds a natural curiosity and urge to explore. To me, being curious is what creativity is all about. I think we have more time and space to breathe down here in Tassie.  Generally, people have short commutes to work and escaping into the wilderness is just so easy when you’re surrounded by it.",

It’s easier to see the middle from the edge.",
    unique:
      "Tasmania’s creative community is a small ecosystem, where each creative act seems more visible and richer in its potential to affect the rest of that system. Artists tend to be influenced by the environment and society that surrounds them, and so Tasmania reflects its own uniqueness through its artists.",
